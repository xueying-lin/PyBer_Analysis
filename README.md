# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
   As a new data analyst of PyBer, a python-based ride-sharing app company, my task is to perform an exploratory analysis on data, and create data visulization to showcase the relationship between the type of city, the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. 
  - Purpose: The visualized analysis report can help PyBer to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine the affordability for underserved neighbourhoods.

## Results
From the summary table:

![Summary: the statistics about the fare, rides, drivers by different types of city](https://github.com/xueying-lin/PyBer_Analysis/blob/af0134ba22d9194149bdd618b7324a8edc4dc845/analysis/summary.PNG)

- The number of **Total Rides** and **Total Drivers** of ***Urban*** cities ranks the ***highest***, ***Suburban*** cities the ***second***, and ***Rural*** cities the ***lowest***. 
- However, the rank of **Average Fare per Ride** and **Average Fare per Driver** reverse, the average price of ***Urban*** cities is the ***cheapist***; the average price of ***Rural*** cities is the ***most expensive*** one, and the average price of ***Suburban*** cities rank in the middle, no matter for average fare per ride or per driver.
- Even though the unit price per ride and per driver of *Urban* cities is cheap, due to the high volume of rides and drivers, **Total Fares** of the ***Urban*** cities remain the ***highest***, the ***Suburban*** cities rank in the middle, and the ***Rural*** cities is the ***lowest*** one. 
*(The line chart of total fare by city type from Jan 2019 to May 2019 can also support this finding)*

## Summary
Based on the results, there are three business recommendation to improve the access to ride-sharing services 
 1. Enlarge the promotion and improve the access to ride-sharing app in rural areas and suburban areas to attract more drivers. Due to the less trasportation support, people lives in the rural areas should have a higher demand of car using. The company may need more research to address the barriers to people live in rural and suburban cities.
 2. Adjust the fare for rural and suburban drivers to make sure their average fare per driver is not much higher than the ones of urban drivers. Normally, there is less people live in rural and suburban cities than urban cities, and the average income of rural and suburban drivers may not as high as the urban drivers. Adjusting the fare may attract more drivers to use the ride-sharing app.
 3. Add more access flexibility and reward systems for drivers. Access flexibility such as more drop-in and drop-off areas, return in different locations, and more car type choice may increase people's interest to use the app. Also, adding a good rewarding systems, such as credit systems are more likely to keep the old customers and attract new customers.
